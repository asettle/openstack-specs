  This template should be in ReSTructured text.  For help with syntax,
  see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html

  To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox, or see:
  http://rst.ninjs.org

  The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL,
  for example a URL of
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack/+spec/awesome-thing should be
  named specs/awesome-thing.rst.

  Wrap text at 79 columns.

  Do not delete any of the sections in this template.  If you have
  nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None

  If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, ascii
  diagrams are required.  http://asciiflow.com/ is a very nice tool to
  assist with making ascii diagrams.  The reason for this is that the
  tool used to review specs is based purely on plain text.  Plain text
  will allow review to proceed without having to look at additional
  files which can not be viewed in gerrit.  It will also allow inline
  feedback on the diagram itself.

==================================
 The title of your spec or policy
==================================

Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:

https://blueprints.launchpad.net//+spec/example

Introduction paragraph -- why are we doing anything?

Problem description
===================

A detailed description of the problem.

Proposed change
===============

Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How
do you propose to solve this problem?

If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece
ends. In other words, what's the scope of this effort?

Include where in the openstack tree hierarchy this will reside.

Alternatives
------------

This is an optional section, where it does apply we'd just like a
demonstration that some thought has been put into why the proposed
approach is the best one.

Implementation
==============

Assignee(s)
-----------

Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a specification
where you're throwing it out there to see who picks it up?

If more than one person is working on the implementation, please
designate the primary author and contact.

Primary assignee:
  name, IRC nic, etc.

Can optionally can list additional ids if they intend on doing
substantial implementation work.

Work Items
----------

Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need
to be done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by
different people, but we're mostly trying to understand the time-line
for implementation.


Dependencies
============

- Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in OpenStack,
  or in other projects, that this one either depends on or is related
  to.

- Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code
  otherwise not included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific
  version of library?
